What have we used in our current prototypes-

Progress made so far –

Integrated the Raspberry Pi 5 with the WM8960 Audio HAT, enabling microphone input and speaker output for user interaction and audio feedback.
Implemented functionality to process user voice prompts and interact with a Language Learning Model (LLM).
Connected and controlled an addressable LED strip for visual feedback, triggered dynamically.
Integrated a temperature and humidity sensor to collect data and send it to AWS IoT for monitoring.
Configured AWS IoT to send JSON payloads to control the device, triggering light, sound, and text-to-speech actuation.
Modified the IR blaster functionality to regulate the AC temperature, ensuring the user sleeps in an ideal temperature environment.
Developed a Python-based system setup that runs as a service, ensuring all functionalities start automatically on boot.
Implemented backend automation to fetch routines and execute them on the device dynamically. (Scheduler)
Integrated spotifyd service and connected the same to AWS backend to play music/songs directly on Naphome.
Access point, Device/User registration working end to end for first time users.
Implemented Voice 2 Voice capability (Eleven Labs) where user can have a conversation with the device.
